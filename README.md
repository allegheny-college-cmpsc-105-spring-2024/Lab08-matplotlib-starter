## Goal

The goal of this lab is to make two plots of your observations from Lab 7 by
using matplotlib.

## How to start

0. Make sure you ubnderstand the samplefigs.py examples and feel free to use
them as referernces for making your own plots.

1. Using lab 7 as a base, please make a plot that is capable of showing your
observations individually
  - dont forget to add all appropriate labels, titles, legends, etc.
2. Using lab 7 as a base, please make a plot that visualized your hypothesis
test
  - dont forget to include overlays that show important points like the mean.
  - use plt.errorbar to show the standard error of the mean
3. Please make one more figure following a matplotlib example to practice
your skills.

## Deliverables

There is no blog post due. Instead, please copy your technical report for
lab 7 and integrate the first two figures into the report for lab 7. Make any
changes you wish to explain the figures within the report as neccessary.

All new code and images need to be submitted in your repo for lab 8.
Additionally the  updated version of the technical report should also be
included.
